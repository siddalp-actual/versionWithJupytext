# versionWithJupytext

I use JupyterLab for making notes about ideas I'm working with, it's so useful to run a few lines of code to try things out.

This project is to play with a plugin called Jupytext which reduces the change load in the JupyterLab notebook, making diffs look
more sensible and so version control possible.
